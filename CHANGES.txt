CHANGES
--------------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------------
 v1.1
--------------------------------------------------
-Includes new version of XVTM : the mouse cursor has been partially decoupled from Views and is therefore not always dependent on the view's refresh rate (which itself depends on the complexity of the graph). This means that it should make controlling the mouse cursor in large graphs much easier.
-Fixed a bug in the SVG Export module (vertical offset problem in some cases)
-Fixed the "looping spline" problem related to graphviz not taking into account the direction of the spline when encoding the SVG path coordinates
-Modified layout of items in the list of properties (property browser)
-Modified makefiles and launch scripts to reflect the change of name VTM -> XVTM
-Fixed temporary file deletion bug (temp files were not deleted when exiting IsaViz)
-updated RDFLoader to take into account changes in Jena 1.3.2 w.r.t separation between namespace and local name of a resource 

--------------------------------------------------
 v1.0a
--------------------------------------------------
-Adapted the dot/SVG module to support the new SVG output structure in Graphviz/dot 1.8.4

--------------------------------------------------
 v1.0
